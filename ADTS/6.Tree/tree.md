each element in a tree has a parent element and zero or more children elements. 

If T is nonempty, it has a special node, called the root of T, that has no parent.
Each node v of T different from the root has a unique parent node w; every node with parent w is a child of w.

Two nodes that are children of the same parent are siblings. A node v is external if v has no children. A node v is internal if it has one or more children. External nodes are also known as leaves.

A tree is ordered if there is a linear ordering defined for the children of each node
